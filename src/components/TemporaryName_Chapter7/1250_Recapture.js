// These are always taxed at a 25% instead of the 0,15,20 rates.

// If there are recapture provisions, the max rate taxable is 25%

// For example, the lesser of depreciation or realized gains will be taxes at 25%.
// The appreciation in value ( selling price - cost basis  NOT ADJUSTED BASIS)
// will incur a seperate tax rate calculated at the appropriate rates, not to exceed 20% 

// Write a basic function that requires the recapture module.
// Tax that at this rate..
